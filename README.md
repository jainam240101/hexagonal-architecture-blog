<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Every developer wants to build a scalable backend infrastructure that can handle queries in milliseconds. Choosing an architecture that fits all of the requirements is a difficult decision to make since you want it to be efficient. After reading a blog post on how Netflix uses hexagonal design to scale their system. I considered sharing my expertise on how to use GoLang to achieve this design.
